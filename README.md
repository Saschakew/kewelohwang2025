# Interactive SVAR Visualizer

This project is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate and visualize the concepts behind Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) modeling. It allows users to explore how different parameters and estimation techniques affect the identification of structural shocks from reduced-form residuals.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Data Generation:** Generate sample data (structural and reduced-form shocks) on the fly.
- **Dynamic Parameter Control:** Adjust parameters like sample size (T), rotation angle (φ), and regularization strength (λ) using interactive sliders.
- **Multiple Estimation Methods:**
    - Identification through recursive assumptions.
    - Identification using non-Gaussian properties of the data.
    - Identification using Ridge regularization for heteroskedasticity.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Scatter plots and loss function plots update instantly as parameters are changed.
- **Dynamic LaTeX Rendering:** Mathematical formulas and matrices are rendered dynamically to reflect the current state of the model.
- **Modular UI:** The user interface is built with a factory pattern for easily adding new controls and sections.
- **In-depth Explanations:** Each section is accompanied by detailed explanations of the underlying theory and mathematics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as a client-side web application with no server-side dependencies.

## Core JavaScript Modules

- **`main.js`**: The central orchestrator. It handles loading the HTML for each section and then calls the initialization functions for all the interactive components.
- **`shared_data.js`**: A global object (`window.sharedData`) that holds the application's state, including the generated data (`epsilon_t`, `u_t`), user-set parameters (`T`, `phi`, `lambda`), and estimation results.
- **`shared_controls.js`**: Contains the logic to initialize all the shared UI controls (like the sliders for T, phi, and lambda) and attach the necessary event listeners. It ensures controls are synchronized and that changes trigger the correct data regeneration and plot updates.
- **`ui_factory.js`**: Implements a factory pattern to programmatically create UI controls. This ensures consistency and simplifies adding new sliders or buttons.
- **`svar_functions.js` & `svar_math_util.js`**: The mathematical core of the application. These files contain the functions for generating shocks, performing Cholesky decomposition, calculating loss functions, and estimating the structural parameters.
- **`plot_utils.js`**: A utility module for creating, updating, and managing all the Plotly.js charts used in the visualizer.
- **`latex_utils.js` & `dynamic_latex_manager.js`**: Manages the dynamic display of mathematical notation, ensuring that matrices and equations shown on the page accurately reflect the current data and parameters.

## Setup and Running

No build process or dependencies are required.

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

Due to browser security policies regarding local file access (CORS), you may need to run a simple local web server to ensure all features work correctly. A common way to do this is with Python:

```bash
# From the project root directory:
python -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deployment to AWS EC2

This section covers the setup and deployment process for the website on an AWS EC2 instance running Nginx.

### Initial Server Setup

This is a one-time setup process for a new EC2 instance.

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   An AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux.
    *   Nginx installed and running.
    *   SSH access to the instance.
    *   A domain name configured to point to your EC2 instance's public IP.

2.  **Add SSH Deploy Key to GitHub:**
    *   On the EC2 instance, generate a new SSH key with a specific name (e.g., `vis6_key`) to avoid overwriting other keys. The `-f` flag specifies the filename.
        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/vis6_key
        ```
    *   Copy the **public** key content. The filename will have `.pub` at the end.
        ```bash
        cat ~/.ssh/vis6_key.pub
        ```
    *   In your GitHub `Illustrations` repository settings, go to `Settings > Deploy Keys > Add deploy key`, paste the key, and give it a title (e.g., "SVAR Visualizer Deploy Key"). Do not check "Allow write access".

3.  **Configure SSH to Use the New Key for GitHub:**
    *   Create or edit the SSH config file to tell Git which key to use for `github.com`.
        ```bash
        nano ~/.ssh/config
        ```
    *   Add the following block to the file. This ensures that any SSH connection to `github.com` uses your specific key.
        ```
        Host github.com
          HostName github.com
          User git
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/vis6_key
        ```
    *   Save and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).
    *   Set the correct permissions for the config file for security:
        ```bash
        chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
        ```

4.  **Clone Repository:**
    *   Now you can clone the repository from the home directory (`~`), and Git will automatically use the correct key.
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:Saschakew/Illustrations.git
        ```
    *   **Note:** This project resides within the `visualization6` subdirectory of the `Illustrations` repository. The deployment commands below are configured to only use the contents of this specific subdirectory.

5.  **Configure Nginx:**
    *   Create the web directory:
        ```bash
        sudo mkdir -p /var/www/svar-visualizer
        ```
    *   Create and edit the Nginx configuration file using a command-line text editor like `nano`:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/svar-visualizer.conf
        ```
    *   Once the editor is open, copy the following `server` block into it, which is pre-filled with your domain name:
        ```nginx
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name KewelohWang2025.sascha-keweloh.com;
            root /var/www/svar-visualizer;
            index index.html;
            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
            }
        }
        ```
    *   Test the Nginx configuration: `sudo nginx -t`

6.  **Set Up SSL with Certbot:**
    *   Run Certbot to obtain and install an SSL certificate. It will automatically update your Nginx configuration for HTTPS.
        ```bash
        sudo certbot --nginx
        ```
    *   Reload Nginx to apply changes: `sudo systemctl reload nginx`

7.  **Set Final Permissions:**
    *   Give the Nginx user ownership of the web directory:
        ```bash
        sudo chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/svar-visualizer
        ```

### Deploying Updates

This is the standard process for deploying updates to the live site.

1.  **Connect to the EC2 Instance:**
    ```bash
    ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP
    ```
    *Replace `/path/to/your-key.pem` and `YOUR_EC2_PUBLIC_IP` with your actual key path and EC2 public IP address.*

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ~/Illustrations
    ```

3.  **Pull the latest changes from GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

4.  **Sync files to the web root:**
    *This command copies the contents of the `visualization6` sub-directory to your web server's root directory.*
    ```bash
    sudo rsync -av --delete ~/Illustrations/visualization6/ /var/www/svar-visualizer/
    ```
